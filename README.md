# Identity and Wallet Standards

## Mission Statement

This group works towards the development and adoption of ICRC standards related to identity and wallets on the Internet
Computer. This repository is used to collaborate, document decisions, discuss changes, raise issues and provide
feedback.

## Process

The following process is followed for standards within this working group.

If you have a good idea or a need for a standard, feel free join a meeting or bring it up on the [forum][FORUM]
or [Discord][DISCORD].

Keep in mind it should be related to Identity and/or Wallets built on the IC to be picked up. In case you have other
ideas, still feel free to reach out, we'll try to help you find the right working group.

These ideas are then translated into the draft standards by their original contributor and/or with help of members
within this working group. Draft standards enable developers to create early reference implementations.

Approved standards are actively being implemented by developers and candidates for an official ICRC standard once
adoption has reached an adequate level.

## Standards

Before jumping into the standards, it's recommended to read the overview [here](./topics/signer_standards_overview.md).

  one of the meetings, please bring it up on the [forum][FORUM] or [Discord][DISCORD].

## Working Group Members

The working group sessions are public and everybody is welcome. If you are interested in discussions about identity and
authentication on the IC, please join us.

### Permanent Members

* DFINITY lead: [Thomas Gladdines](https://github.com/sea-snake)

## Supported Signers

The following list of signers have implemented or are implementing the standards in this working group:

- [NFID](https://nfid.one)
- [OISY](https://oisy.com)
- [Plug](https://www.plugwallet.ooo)
- [PrimeVault](https://www.primevault.com)

Wallets and identity providers not listed here, might still be supported through adapters available in libraries and
frameworks that implement the standards.

Have you implemented the standards and your wallet isn't listed here? Contact us on the [forum][FORUM]
or [Discord][DISCORD].

## Libraries and Frameworks

For a library that implements the above signer standards
see [signer-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@slide-computer/signer).

If you are looking to get started quickly, consider a framework like [IdentityKit](https://www.identitykit.xyz) that
already implements the user interface, error handling, sessions and other details around wallets interaction.
