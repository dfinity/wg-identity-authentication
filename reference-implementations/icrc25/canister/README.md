# Example ICRC-21 Canister

## Running the project locally

Make sure [the IC SDK](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install/) is installed on your machine. Then run:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background --clean

# Switches to your default account
dfx identity use default

# Deploys the ledger canister with a fixed id, sets the icrc21_backend canister as minter and current (default) identity as the canister's controller
dfx deploy ledger --specified-id wkw6r-kyaaa-aaaao-a2hma-cai --argument "(variant {Init = record { token_name = \"DEV\"; token_symbol = \"DEV\"; transfer_fee = 1; metadata = vec {}; minting_account = record {owner = principal \"xhy27-fqaaa-aaaao-a2hlq-cai\";}; initial_balances = vec {}; archive_options = record {num_blocks_to_archive = 1000000; trigger_threshold = 1000000; controller_id = principal \"$(dfx identity get-principal)\"}; }})"

# Deploys the icrc21_backend canister with a fixed id
dfx deploy icrc21_backend --specified-id xhy27-fqaaa-aaaao-a2hlq-cai --argument "(opt record { ledger_canister_id = principal \"wkw6r-kyaaa-aaaao-a2hma-cai\"; })"
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `production` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
