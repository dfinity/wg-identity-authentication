## Summary

The purpose of the `icrc32_sign_challenge` method is for the relying party to receive a cryptographic proof of ownership for the users identities.

## Method

**Name and Scope:** `icrc32_sign_challenge`

**Prerequisite:** Active session with granted permission scope `icrc32_sign_challenge` or `*`.

## Request

**`version` (`text`):** The version of the standard used. If the signer does not support the version of the request, it must send the `"VERSION_NOT_SUPPORTED"` error in response.

**`challenge` (`blob`):** A challenge used for the signer to sign in order to prove its access to the identity. The challenge should be an array of 32 cryptographically random bytes generated from a secure random source by the sender of the request.

**Example RPC Request**:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "icrc32_sign_challenge",
  "params": {
    "version": "1",
    "challenge": "UjwgsORvEzp98TmB1cAIseNOoD9+GLyN/1DzJ5+jxZM="
  }
}
```

## Response

`version` (`text`): The version of the standard used. It must match the `version` from the request.

`identities`: A list of identities the user has selected to share with the relying party.

- `publicKey` (`blob`): The DER-encoded public key associated with the identity, derived in accordance with one of [the signature algorithms supported by the IC](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec/#signatures). The public key can be used to [derive a self-authenticating principal](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec/#principal).
- `signature` (`blob`): The signature produced by signing the concatenation of the domain separator `\x13ic-signer-challenge` (UTF-8 encoded) and the challenge with the private key associated with the identity.

### Example RPC Response

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "version": "1",
    "identities": [
      {
        "publicKey": "MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG",
        "signature": "MEUCIQDQ8Z3Z"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Message Processing

1. The relying party sends a `icrc31_list_identities` request to the signer.
2. Upon receiving the message, the signer first checks if it can process the message.
    - If the request version is not supported by the signer, the signer sends a response with an error back to the relying party.
    - If the relying party has not been granted the permission to request the action, the signer sends a response with an error back to the relying party.
3. Next, the signer lets the user select identities that will be included in the response.
    - If the user has previously selected identities for the same relying party on the same session, the signer may skip the user interaction.
4. The signer signs the challenge with the private keys associated with the selected identities and sends a successful response back to the relying party with the list of selected identities and the matching signatures.
5. After receiving a successful response, the relying party verifies that the signer has access to the private key associated with the provided identities:
    - Determine the public key for verifying the signature of the challenge for each identity:
      - If `delegation` is present and non-empty:
        - If the `delegation` array contains more than 20 elements, the relying party rejects the response.
        - The relying party validates that all delegations are not expired according to their respective `expiration` timestamp.
        - The relying party validates all `signature` values of all delegations in the `delegation` list. For the first delegation in the array, this signature must be valid with respect to the public key corresponding to the `publicKey` field of the identity, all subsequent delegations are signed with the key corresponding to the public key contained in the preceding delegation. The key to validate the challenge signature is the public key contained in the last delegation in the array.
      - Otherwise the key to validate the challenge signature with is the public key contained in the `publicKey` field of the identity.
    - The relying party retrieves the public key to verify the challenge from each identity according to the previous step, determines the `signature` scheme and verifies whether it was generated by signing the concatenation of the domain separator `\x13ic-signer-challenge` (UTF-8 encoded) and the `challenge` from the request with the private key associated with that public key.
        - If the signature verification succeeds for all `identities`, the relying party accepts the response.
        - If the signature verification fails for any `identities` value, the relying party rejects the response.

## Errors

This standard does not define additional errors. See [ICRC-25](./icrc_25_signer_interaction_standard.md#errors-4) for a list of errors that can be returned by all methods.
