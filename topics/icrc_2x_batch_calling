## Batch Calls

JSON-RPC defines a [batch call](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#batch) as a JSON array of requests. All methods defined in this standard may also be invoked as part of a batch.

If a signer receives a batch call, it must process each request sequentially in order of the id and reply with a batch response. Calls resulting in error responses do not prevent the processing of subsequent calls in the batch.
